    "This Python Notebook provides the code to create a simple AI agent for risk and interest rate evaluation in a bank loan processing scenario. Once created, you assume the persona of a loan risk analyst at a bank and ask the Loan Risk AI Agent questions in natural language to assess risks for customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a question is asked, the AI agent will use a LLM to understand the context, determine the seqence of steps, and then complete the steps utilizing availble tools. The tools fetch customer information, credit score, account status and determine risk and interest rate. The sequence of steps, tool calling and final response can be reviewed in the output.\n",
